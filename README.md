# Job Applicant Dashboard

This is a Django web application designed to serve as a Job Applicant Dashboard for the "Junior Developer" position. It allows administrators to manage applicant information, view their portfolios, and delete applicant records.

## Features

* **Portfolio Management:** Create and manage applicant portfolios and associated projects via the Django Admin.
* **User Integration:** Utilizes Django's built-in User model for applicant information.
* **Detailed Portfolio View:** A dedicated page to view an applicant's full portfolio and their submitted projects.
* **Applicant Deletion:** Functionality to delete an applicant, which also removes their associated portfolio and projects.
* **Bootstrap Styling:** Uses Bootstrap for a clean and responsive user interface, served as a local static CDN.
